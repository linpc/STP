1. To install STP perform the following steps on your
Unix/GNU-Linux/MacOS X commandline:

./clean-install.sh

2. To test the system after installation, you will need to download
the regression tests. The regression are 190MB big, so are stored
separately. To download them, try something like:

svn co
https://stp-fast-prover.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/stp-fast-prover/stp-tests/test

The directory of the regression tests is hard-coded in /bin/run_tests,
which you may need to update, depending on where you checkout the
regression tests to.

To run the regression tests: make regressall

NB: 

* If you want to compile a statically linked version of STP, run
./liblinks.sh after the configure script, and then compile adding
STATIC=true to the make commands.
